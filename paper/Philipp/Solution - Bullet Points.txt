- original data sequence is attempted to be recreated, using HMM and sequence of emission values
- for calculations, the transitional matrix is given through the HMM
- also providing initial transition matrix
- matrix of emission probabilities per state through sequence of emission values
- building maximum reachable paths from start to finish
- paths to state s' until timestep t + 1 are formed, using the maximum path for state s until timestep t, so that 
  transition s -> s' from t -> t + 1 is highest probable transition
- finally max reachable probability for state s until timestep t is then multiplied with probability to emit
  specific symbol on timestep t
- for each calculated max reachable probability by state, the previous state, that was used to build the probability for
  the current state, is saved alongside the probability
- highest probability end state is then deciphered using state at final timestep with highest reachability probability
- highest probability path is then deciphered by back-propagating from highest probability end state to beginning,
  by iterating alongside previously saved states, that contributed to the max reachable probability per state
- resulting path then is the attempted recreation of the original data sequence
- algorithm will have relatively low amount of errors, though it can not ensure perfect sequence recreations
